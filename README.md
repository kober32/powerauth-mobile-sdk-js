# PowerAuth SDK for React Native Mobile Apps

In order to connect to the [PowerAuth](https://www.wultra.com/product/powerauth-mobile-security-suite) service, mobile applications need to perform the required network and cryptographic processes, as described in the PowerAuth documentation. To simplify implementation of these processes, developers can use React Native library (for Android and iOS) from this repository.

*More information will be added later. For now, you can visit the [native PowerAuth SDK for Mobile Apps](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-mobile-sdk) as this library acts just as a bridge between the Javascript environment and the native module.*
